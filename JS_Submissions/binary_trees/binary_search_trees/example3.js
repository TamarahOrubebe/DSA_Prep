Example 3: 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid BST.

Recall an earlier example problem where we needed to determine if two trees were the same tree. In that problem, 
we determined that if a node p and q represent the same tree, then their left and right subtrees must also be 
identical to each other.

If a tree rooted at node is a binary search tree, then node.left and node.right must also be binary search 
trees. Because the function isValidBST we are implementing determines if a tree is a binary search tree, we have 
a recursive way to look at the problem.

isValidBST(node.left) && isValidBST(node.right) must be true, and also the current node's value must not violate 
the BST property.

To determine if a node's value is violating the BST property, we can use two arguments small and large. These 
represent the (exclusive) range (small, large) in which a node's value should fall under. If a node's value is not in this range, then it is violating the BST property and we can return false.

The root node can have any value, so we initialize small = -infinity and large = infinity.

Every node in the root's left subtree must be less than root.val, so when we call on the left subtree, we can 
pass large = root.val.

Every node in the root's right subtree must be greater than root.val, so when we call on the right subtree, 
we can pass small = root.val.

By updating small and large in this manner, we ensure that the constraint that determines if a node's value is 
acceptable is always accurate, as recursion will keep a copy of small and large for each node.

As a base case, when we encounter an empty tree, we return true. Again, think about the case where the input 
tree is a single node. Any node on its own is by definition a binary search tree, so we would need both 
isValidBST(root.left) and isValidBST(root.right) to return true, so we need the empty tree to return true.

var isValidBST = function(root) {
    let dfs = (node, small, large) => {
        if (!node) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (small >= node.val || node.val >= large) {
            return false;
        }
        
        let left = dfs(node.left, small, node.val);
        let right = dfs(node.right, node.val, large);
        
        // tree is a bst if left and right subtrees are also BSTs
        return left && right;
    }
    
    return dfs(root, -Infinity, Infinity);
};

// The time and space complexity are both O(n)O(n) for the same reasons as all the other examples.

 How Many Apples Can You Put into the Basket

Solution
You have some apples and a basket that can carry up to 5000 units of weight.

Given an integer array weight where weight[i] is the weight of the ith apple, return the maximum number of 
apples you can put in the basket.

 

Example 1:

Input: weight = [100,200,150,1000]
Output: 4
Explanation: All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.
Example 2:

Input: weight = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]
Output: 5
Explanation: The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose any 5 of them.
 

Constraints:

1 <= weight.length <= 103
1 <= weight[i] <= 103

var maxNumberOfApples = function(weight) {
    weight.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let sum = 0;
    let ans = 0;
    for(const apple of weight) {
        sum += apple;
         if (sum <= 5000) {
             ans += 1;   
         } else {
            break;
         }
    }
    return ans;
};

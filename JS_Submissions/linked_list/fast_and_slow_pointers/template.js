Fast and slow pointers
Report Issue
Fast and slow pointers is an implementation of the two pointers technique that we learned in the arrays and strings chapter. The idea is to have two pointers that don't move side by side. This could mean they move at different "speeds" during iteration, begin iteration from different locations, or any other abstract difference.

When the pointers move at different speeds, usually the "fast" pointer moves two nodes per iteration, whereas the "slow" pointer moves one node per iteration (although this is not always the case). Here's some pseudocode:

// head is the head node of a linked list
function fn(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        Do something here
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.
        
The reason we need the while condition to also check for fast.next is because if fast is at the final node, 
then fast.next is null, and trying to access fast.next.next would result in an error (you would be doing null.
next).

Monotonic
Report Issue
Note: if you're a beginner and struggle to grasp this article, don't be discouraged! This is one of the most 
difficult concepts taught in this course. Good news is, the concept is not super common in interviews, but still 
a good one to know. If you find yourself stuck, don't worry about moving on and coming back later.

Monotonic: (of a function or quantity) varying in such a way that it either never decreases or never increases.

A monotonic stack or queue is one whose elements are always sorted. It can be sorted either ascending or 
descending, depending on the algorithm. Monotonic stacks and queues maintain their sorted property by removing 
elements that would violate the property before adding new elements. For example, let's say you had a 
monotonically increasing stack, currently stack = [1, 5, 8, 15, 23]. You want to push 14 onto the stack. 
To maintain the sorted property, we need to first pop the 15 and 23 before pushing the 14 - after the push 
operation, we have stack = [1, 5, 8, 14].

*************
Here's some pseudocode for maintaining a monotonic increasing stack over an input array:

Given an integer array nums

stack = []
for num in nums:
    while stack.length > 0 AND stack.top >= num:
        stack.pop()
    // Between the above and below lines, do some logic depending on the problem
    stack.push(num)

**************    
As you can see, before we push a num onto the stack, we first check if the monotonic property would be violated, 
and pop elements until it won't be.

As we discussed earlier in the sliding window chapter, despite the nested loop, the time complexity is still 
O(n)O(n), where nn is the length of the array, because the inner while loop can only iterate over each element 
once across all for loop iterations, making the for loop iterations amortized O(1)O(1).

Monotonic stacks and queues are useful in problems that, for each element, involves finding the "next" element 
based on some criteria, for example, the next greater element. They're also good when you have a dynamic window 
of elements and you want to maintain knowledge of the maximum or minimum element as the window changes. In more 
advanced problems, sometimes a monotonic stack or queue is only one part of the algorithm. Let's look at some 
examples.

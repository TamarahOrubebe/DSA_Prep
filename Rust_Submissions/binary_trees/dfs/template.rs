/* 
The good news is that the structure for performing a DFS is very similar across all problems. It goes as follows:

Handle the base case(s). Usually, an empty tree (node = null) is a base case.
Do some logic for the current node
Recursively call on the current node's children
Return the answer
As we will see in a moment, steps 2 and 3 may happen in different orders.

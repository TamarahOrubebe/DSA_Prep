// Example 1: 1046. Last Stone Weight

/*You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the i^th stone. On each turn, we 
choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y 
with x <= y. If x == y, then both stones are destroyed. If x != y, then x is destroyed and y loses x weight. 
Return the weight of the last remaining stone, or 0 if there are no stones left.

/*
On each smash, at least one rock is destroyed, so there can be at most n iterations. At each iteration, we 
perform pops and pushes on the heap, which has a length of n at the start. This gives us a time complexity of 
O(nâ‹…logn). The heap uses O(n) space. Note that in Python we are re-using the input, so we should count it 
towards the space complexity, which we wouldn't normally do.

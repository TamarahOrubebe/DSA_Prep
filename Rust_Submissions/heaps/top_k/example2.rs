/*
The time complexity of this algorithm is O((n+k)⋅logk), where n is the length of the input array. The heap size 
never grows beyond k, so the push and pop operations are O(logk), which we perform nn times. Then, we need 
O(k⋅logk) at the end to sort the output. This algorithm is actually pretty slow compared to other approaches 
since it does not exploit the fact that the input array is sorted - but we're using it as an example of how 
heaps can be used in "top k" problems. This approach is still faster than sorting with a custom comparator, 
which is the trivial approach.

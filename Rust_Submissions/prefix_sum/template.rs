Prefix sum
Prefix sum is a technique that can be used on arrays (of numbers). The idea is to create an array prefix where 
prefix[i] is the sum of all elements up to the index i (inclusive). For example, given nums = [5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 8],
we would have prefix = [5, 7, 8, 14, 17, 25].

When a subarray starts at index 0, it is considered a "prefix" of the array. A prefix sum represents the sum of 
all prefixes. 

Prefix sums allow us to find the sum of any subarray in O(1)O(1). If we want the sum of the subarray from i to j 
(inclusive), then the answer is prefix[j] - prefix[i - 1], or prefix[j] - prefix[i] + nums[i] if you don't want 
to deal with the out of bounds case when i = 0.

This works because prefix[i - 1] is the sum of all elements before index i. When you subtract this from the sum 
of all elements up to index j, you are left with the sum of all elements starting at index i and ending at index 
j, which is exactly what we are looking for.

Building a prefix sum is very simple. Here's some pseudocode:

Given an array nums,

prefix = [nums[0]]
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
    prefix.append(nums[i] + prefix[prefix.length - 1])
    
Initially, we start with just the first element. Then we iterate with i starting from index 1. At any given 
point, the last element of prefix will represent the sum of all the elements in the input up to but not including
index i. So we can add that value plus the current value to the end of prefix and continue to the next element.

A prefix sum is a great tool whenever a problem involves sums of a subarray. It only costs O(n) to build but 
allows all future subarray queries to be O(1)O(1), so it can usually improve an algorithm's time complexity by a 
factor of O(n), where nn is the length of the array. Let's look at some examples.

Building a prefix sum is a form of pre-processing. Pre-processing is a useful strategy in a variety of problems
where we store pre-computed data in a data structure before running the main logic of our algorithm. While it 
takes some time to pre-process, it's an investment that will save us a huge amount of time during the main parts 
of the algorithm.
